# Minimal Summary Guidelines

## Summary Requirements

When completing tasks, keep your final summary EXTREMELY brief:

- Maximum 1-2 sentences
- State only what was accomplished
- NO bullet points
- NO detailed explanations
- NO repetition of steps taken
- NO markdown formatting in summaries

## Examples

Good: "Created the authentication module and updated the config file."

Bad: "I've successfully completed the task! Here's what I did:
- Created authentication module
- Updated configuration
- Tested the implementation
Everything is working perfectly!"

## Token Efficiency

Minimize token usage by:
- Avoiding verbose recaps
- Skipping unnecessary details
- Being direct and concise
- Not repeating what you just did
